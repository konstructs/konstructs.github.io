# Playing Konstructs

Konstructs is a creative game that lets you build and evolve a world
constructed from big cubes. If you have played Minecraft or
Infiniminer you will be familiar with the basic concept of this game.

## Getting started

- [Download the client](http://www.konstructs.org/download/).
- Connect the client to <code>play.konstructs.org</code> (this is the
  default address)
- Choose a username and a password

You are now playing konstructs, congratulations!

## Finding your way around

You can explore the world using the following, possibly familiar,
controls:

- <code>W</code> moves the character forward
- <code>A</code> moves the character to the left
- <code>S</code> moves the character backward
- <code>D</code> moves the character right.
- <code>Space</code> makes the character jump.

Use the mouse the change the direction of the character and to look up
and down.

The world consist of different block types. Some are solid, some you
can walk through and some you can see through. Have a look around!

## Interacting with the world

You can interact with the world in three ways. The two first ways are
fairly intuitive. Press the <code>left mouse button</code> to pick up
a block. It will be put into your belt. To put a block back into the
world, press the <code>right mouse button</code>. You can select which
of the slot in your belt you want to use by using either the
<code>buttons 1-9</code> or the <code>scroll wheel</code>. You now
everything you need to know change the world.

Some of the blocks in the world are not easily found, but can be
easily crafted. To craft a block you need to use the small yellow
block that you had in your belt already when you joined. This block is
your "tool sack" and it can be interacted with in the third
way. When you have selected the slot in your belt that contains the
"tool sack", you can press either <code>E</code> or the
<code>middle mouse button</code> to open the tool sack. More
information on how to use the "crafting sack" and some of the items
that can be crafted, can be found
[here](http://www.konstructs.org/documentation/crafting/).

## Having fun

Now it's up to you to decide what you want to build, where you want to
build it and who you want to build it with. Happy playing!
