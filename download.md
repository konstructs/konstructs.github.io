## Windows

Windows builds are cross compiled and packaged from a Linux host
using MinGW. A 32-bit binary are produced that should work on most
Windows installations.

## Linux

We have automatic 64-bit binaries built and packages for Linux. The tar.bz2 file should work on most Linux distributions with the appropriate libraries installed. We also provide a deb package for Debian based distributions, like for example Ubuntu.

## OS X

We do not have any automatic builds for OS X because we do not have the hardware to nether run or test the game. We have reports on successful builds on latest OS X so you should be able to build it from source, for that, follow the instructions over at [GitHub](https://github.com/konstructs/client/blob/master/BUILD.md).

# Server

You only need the server if you like to host your own private server, play offline or prefer to play alone. For everything else, you have a public server hosted at `play.konstructs.org`.
