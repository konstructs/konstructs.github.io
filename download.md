## Windows

Windows builds are cross compiled and packaged from a Linux host
using MinGW. A 32-bit binary are produced that should work on most
Windows installations.

We release binaries for Linux as a <a href="https://snapcraft.io">snap</a>. Snap works with Arch, Debian, Gentoo, Fedora, Ubuntu and more. If you have snapd installed click the button, search for "konstructs-client" in your software store or run the command `sudo snap install konstructs-client` in a terminal.

It's also simple to build it your self from [source](https://github.com/konstructs/client/blob/master/BUILD.md).

## OS X

We do not have any automatic builds for OS X because we do not have the hardware to nether run or test the game. We have reports on successful builds on latest OS X so you should be able to build it from source, for that, follow the instructions over at [GitHub](https://github.com/konstructs/client/blob/master/BUILD.md).

# Server

You only need the server if you like to host your own private server, play offline or prefer to play alone. For everything else, you have a public server hosted at `play.konstructs.org`.
