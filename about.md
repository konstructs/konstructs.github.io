# The beginning

It all started a winter day the around the new year 2014/2015 in Stockholm, Sweden.
Two friends started to tinker and experiment with a game written by
Michael Fogleman called Craft. Our visions started to take shape and we
quickly realized that our take on the game was very different compared to
Foglemanâ€™s game, so we forked it.

The original was based around the client, there was a multiplayer server
but that was more like a simple relay. All the logic happened in the client.
Nothing wrong with that but we had other plans...

Since then, we have stripped the client of features. The idea is to make it
a dumb viewer and make all decisions in the server. This adds some interesting
problems but overall it works really well!

# Architecture

The game is based on three parts, a [client written in C++](https://github.com/konstructs/client), a [server core written in Scala](https://github.com/konstructs/server) and [lots of plugins](/plugins/) that are loaded by the server. Plugins are written in Java or Scala and use a well defined Java API. Together these parts creates a very interesting game.

## The client

Our client processes and receives huge amount of block data from the server.
Block data contains things like light value, rotation and damage information.
A complete list of block types and block textures are compiled by the server
and sent to the client.

We have also added an inventory UI (or Heads Up Display, HUD) that enables plugins to display anything from backpacks or chests to advanced crafting tables or specialized machines. This is all managed from the server, the client has very little idea what's going on!

Because available blocks and textures are sent from the server, this make it possible to add blocks to the game with the help of server plugins. The same is true for the inventory UI, plugins can customize it without any need to update the client. You can use the same client to connect to two different servers with a completely different gaming experiences.

## The server

The server is written in Scala with Akka, the idea is to focus on scalability,
extendability and huge worlds with server driven game logic.

### Scalability - actors

The server is implemented using [Akka](http://akka.io/) actors and the new IO subsystem ported from the [Spray](http://spray.io/) project. We try to keep everything nicely isolated in or behind an actor to make the game easy to scale up (run on multiple cores/CPUs). We hope that this in the long run also will help with scaling out (running the same world on several servers).

### Huge worlds - separated game logic and world

At the core we try to have very simple block format that is shared with the client. We store all blocks compressed using [DEFLATE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFLATE), also when in memory or being sent to the client. This means that we can keep a huge amount of blocks in memory which helps fight IO latency as well as keeping disk IO to a minimum. Actually, one of the unimplemented features is block unloading. So far we never needed it!

Since we can manage a huge amount of blocks, it makes sense to not limit world interaction to where the player is. Therefore we have completely separated all world logic from the world itself. Therefore automatic world interaction is not dependent on the part of the world being loaded, but is always done for all of the world via plugins.

### Extendability - plugins are actors

<div style="float: right; padding: 1em"><iframe width="280" height="158" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MT1qQKVMK1I" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
Since the server is at is core just a set of actors exchanging messages every plugin is created equal. Message interfaces are provided to interact with the block world as well as with players. Persistence are provide by actors capable of loading and storing JSON data on behalf of other actors. It is therefore easy to create a plugin that keeps out of the way of other plugins.

### Server driven game logic - true multiplayer game

To keep the game extremely extensible, while still keeping the client simple, all game logic is implemented server side. This means that for the player there is no need to download different plugins or versions of the client to play different worlds. Plugins mainly interact with the block world and/or using one of the simple features implemented in the client (like the inventory).
