# Release 7

While release 5 & 6 were focused on balancing and improving existing features, release 7 is all about new features.

To further improve the adventure theme of the game we have add health values to blocks. This means that blocks are no longer immediately destroyed, but needs to be repeatedly damaged. Damage is persistent so a block that has been damaged stays damaged. We have also updated the block description to allow blocks to be destroyed into other blocks. One example is dirt with grass on top which is now destroyed into a dirt block.

We also added a dynamic view distance that scales back the view distance if your computer needs it to reduce lag.

As destroying blocks using a non specialized block can be a lot of work, we have also introduced some basic stone tools that can be used to speed up the process.

To allow for new more interesting plugins as well as make building more fun, we have introduced the ability to rotate block in any direction. This is activated on a per block basis so not all blocks can be rotated. One example of a block that can be rotated is wood, this means that one can now build horizontal beams.

We have also created two new plugins showcasing some parts of the new APIs as well as making the underground of konstructs a lot more interesting. There is now [a plugin for generating caves](https://github.com/konstructs/server-plugin-caves) as well as [one for generating ores](https://github.com/konstructs/server-plugin-ore). The result [can be seen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yLKT2qlMyI).
