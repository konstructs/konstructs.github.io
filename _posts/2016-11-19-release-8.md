# Release 8

The big thing in this release is the new light system. The server now calculates light data both from the sky (sunlight) and from ambient light sources, like a touch or a lamp.


## New features

### The Client

- Add support for sky and ambient light.
- Make the main menu a little easier to understand.
- The `F3` debug menu is back.
- Per corner light interpolation.

### The Server:

- Add sky and ambient light.

### Plugins

- [Light stone](https://github.com/konstructs/server-plugin-light-stone) that introduces light sources and control mechanisms to the server in form of kuantum.
