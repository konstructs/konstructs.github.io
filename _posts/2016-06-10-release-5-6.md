# Release 5 & 6

We have been quiet here on the blog for a while, but that is only because we have been busy improving konstructs. Today we created release 6 and then we realized we never posted a blog for release 5.

Release 5 brought a lot of updates to how the world is generated, especially to the plugin API and the plugins themselves. Take a look at [the result!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HmZ1Rk0Kak).

Release 6 was more focused on game play and bug fixes. Now crafting and inventory management is a lot more convenient, allowing management of full stacks, half stacks and single blocks. The player can now sneak around in the world using the SHIFT key. This prevents the player from falling off edges. Network management was also vastly improved now handling different disconnect scenarios without crashing.

## New features

### The Client

- Reworked networking, client now properly handles disconnects
- Crafting is improved so that full stacks can easily be crafted
- Sneak mode was introduced, holding shift avoids falling off edges

### The Server:

- Small changes to protocol due to client rework
- Server world generator now generates an "empty" world for plugins to evolve
- Updates to plugin APIs, latest docs available [here](http://doc.konstructs.org/server-api/index.html)

### Plugins

- [Forest plugin](https://github.com/konstructs/server-plugin-forest) now contains three different types of trees
- [Flowers plugin](https://github.com/konstructs/server-plugin-flowers) now grows more natrually
- [Grass plugin](https://github.com/konstructs/server-plugin-grass) was vastly improved now growing several types of grass (and sand)
