# Release 2

## Gameplay

Our second release is all about konstructing (crafting). The automatic stack generation is gone and replaced by konstructing. It is now possible to konstruct all different types of blocks from only a few base blocks. All list of all current recipes are available [here](http://www.konstructs.org/documentation/konstructing/).
