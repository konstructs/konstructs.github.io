# Release 4

Today we are proud to release our fourth release. It has been nearly
eight months since our first release and this release is now finally
encompassing a playable game. The new C++ client is getting quite
stable and most of the annoying bugs have been solved. On the server
side we have reworked the plugin system and made available a clean API
that can be used by plugin developers. This also means that a lot of
the content development is now taking place in plugins, you can read
more about

### The Server:

  with big performance enhancements for block updates

  [project](https://github.com/konstructs/server-api)
- Complete
  [Plugin API Javadocs](http://doc.konstructs.org/server-api/index.html)
  were written

  day of the server)
