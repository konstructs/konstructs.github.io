# Server documentation

## Running

After downloading the server it can be run using the following command:

<code>
java -cp konstructs-server-build-vx.y.z.jar:plugins/* konstructs.Main
</code>

Where x, y and z is the version number of the server JAR that you [downloaded](/download/#server).

## Plugins

If you run the server using the command from above, any plugin JARs can be placed into a directory named <code>plugins</code>. We try too keep an up to date list of plugins here. If you have built a plugin and want it to be included here, please create an issue for this [here](https://github.com/konstructs/konstructs.github.io/issues).
