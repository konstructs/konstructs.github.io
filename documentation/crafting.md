# Crafting

Crafting is done using a crafting block. On this page the yellow "tool sack" is used. This is part of the core server and will usually be provided to all new players when they initially spawn. To open the "tool sack" select it in the belt and press either the "third mouse button" (this is usually the wheel) or "E". This is an overview of the "tool sack" and the rest of the HUD.
